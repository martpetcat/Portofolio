      <p>This project was a "end of the orientation phase" showcase of the information we had learned thus far - from
        using wireframes, how user data works and is being stored, research docuemntations on personally chosen
        topics, using Arduino Rich Shields, learning basic JavaScript to building websites on our own - and all of that
        we adjusted in a single project. For me adjusting to this variety of content was no easy task mainly because I
        had never been relient on such frequent feedback before. Adjusting to this regime took a long time but I was learning and all of my progress thoughout week 1 - 7 is docuemnted in the <u>MyPEP.docx</u> file. The conclusion I had drawn after this period of time was that teamowrk was all about overcomming communicational problems and looking out for each other as I was in a group in which communication was of the most value.</p>

        <p>Overall I managed my way though this phase of 10 weeks. I tried to communicate with teachers for the most
        part and due to anxiety I would always assure them that though I was not ready to show them anything I was
        working. A problem that was to come. With my deteriating mental health I wasn't the best team member to have.
        Though I was working on my part and was getting recognition for my work I felt like it wasn't enough. Of course 
        its not only bad things that happened. I had an oportunity like no other to try a great ammount of things which 
        I mentioned upwards me and my group included in our final project.</p>
